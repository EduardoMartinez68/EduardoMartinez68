  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #ffffff;">🧠 How did PLUS start?</h2>
  <p>I wanted to use <em>Odoo</em> to build an ERP for law firms in Mexico. My initial thought was:</p>
  <blockquote style="background-color: #111921; padding: 1rem; border-left: 5px solid #888; color: #eee;">
    “This is going to be a piece of cake.”
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> <em>It wasn’t</em> 😅</p>

  <p>I ran into countless incompatibilities, couldn’t understand other developers’ code 👨🏻‍💻, and every time an error popped up, I had to restore entire files 🤯.</p>
  <p><strong>The result?</strong> I never even managed to rename the "Projects" module to "Cases" ⚖️… 😂</p>

  <hr style="border-color: #444;">

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #ffffff;">✨ So I made a decision:</h2>
  <p>I took a deep breath...<br>
     And decided to build my <strong>own ERP ENGINE</strong>.</p>
  <p>With blackjack and hookers? 🃏🍸<br>
     Well, not exactly…</p>

  <p>More like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🧼 Clean code</li>
    <li>🇲🇽 Designed for Mexican businesses</li>
    <li>🧩 Simple customization</li>
    <li>💡 Intuitive interface</li>
    <li>👶 Ideal even for beginner developers</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote style="background-color: #102d46; padding: 1rem; border-left: 5px solid #4da8ff; color: #f0f8ff;">
    In <strong>PLUS</strong>, renaming an app is as easy as a single click.<br>
    Adding dependencies or customizing modules is quick and painless.

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #ffffff;">💬 Personal Note</h2>
  <p>I have absolutely <strong>nothing against Odoo</strong> — in fact, I admire it a lot! 👏</p>
  <p>It’s an impressive and well-designed platform, built in my favorite language: <strong>Python</strong> 🐍❤️.</p>

  <p>But like many developers, whenever I use a tool, I think:  
  <em>"I could make this better (or at least, more my way)"</em> 😅</p>

  <p>Not necessarily better for everyone — just better for me and for other nerds like me who want to help others in this way.</p>

  <p>That’s how this project was born: not as a "competitor" to Odoo, but as a simpler, more focused alternative, built from scratch with love.  
     Designed so even inexperienced developers can build their own business apps with ease.</p>
