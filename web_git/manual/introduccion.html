  <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: #ffffff;">What is PLUS?</h2>

  <p><strong>PLUS ERP</strong> is an open-source project because I deeply believe in the power of community, collaboration, and shared learning 🌎💻.</p>

  <p>Free and open-source software allows us to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Learn from each other</li>
    <li>✅ Adapt tools to our own needs</li>
    <li>✅ Improve the software together</li>
    <li>✅ Democratize access to quality technology</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>PLUS ERP</strong> is free for any company, developer, or curious mind to study, modify, and use.  
  The only thing I ask in return is that you follow a few small conditions, so the community can grow in a healthy and respectful way:</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #ffffff;">🌱 Share Your Improvements</h3>
  <p>If you make any cool modifications or improvements, it would be awesome if you shared them back with the community via Pull Requests or by publishing your fork.  
  That way, we all learn and the project keeps getting better 🚀.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #ffffff;">🔓 Don’t Close the Code</h3>
  <p>You’re not allowed to take this engine and turn it into a closed or proprietary product.  
  The idea is for it to remain open forever — accessible and transparent.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #ffffff;">🤝 Respect Within the Community</h3>
  <p>If a community forms around <strong>PLUS ERP</strong> (forums, Discord, GitHub Issues), please always participate with respect, openness, and good vibes.</p>

  <hr style="border-color: #444;">

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; color: #ffffff;">👉 Why Open Source?</h3>
  <p>Because the magic of open source lies in <strong>collaboration</strong>.  
  By sharing your knowledge and your work, you help others improve the software, learn, and build amazing solutions we might’ve never imagined.</p>

  <p><strong>PLUS ERP</strong> aims to inspire other Mexican and Latin American developers to create tools tailored to our own context, language, businesses, and needs 🎉.</p>

    I've always believed that our purpose as programmers is to create <strong>Technology with a touch of magic</strong> ❤️
